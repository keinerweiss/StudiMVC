StudiMVC - An educational MVC framework for PHP.

===============================================================================

StudiMVC is the result of a lecture I held. Each lecture this MVC is build from 
scratch with beamer projection together with the students in a straight-forward 
way.

This is the result after adding all the security conditions and some helper 
classes which the students then use for exercises.

This way everybody knows what the meaning and the purpose of the code is. 
StudiMVC has grown a bit. But it's not "over-engineered". The purpose is to 
have a secure, fast, readable and easily understandable architecture.

To some it might appear too straight forward and too less abstracted, but 
that's what makes it easy to understand.

Yes, it has been used in production. It perfectly fits into programming 
application APIs.
